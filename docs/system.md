# New System Design

Originally, StochFuzz was integrated into AFL, which made an easy development. However, as more and more advanced fuzzing tools (e.g., [Polyglot](https://github.com/s3team/Polyglot)) take their own implementations (e.g., developing a new variant of AFL), it becomes hard to combine StochFuzz with these tools. 

As such, we decide to separate StochFuzz and AFL. With this new system design, any AFL-based fuzzer can directly fuzz the phantom binary generated by StochFuzz.

However, it also brings some new challenges. 

First of all, it is easy for the old design to keep multiple versions of rewritten binaries at the same time (by modifying AFL to set up multiple fork servers), but not for the new one. Currently, StochFuzz is independent of AFL, which means it can only keep a single binary at a time. Hence, to detect those erroneous rewriting errors only changing execution paths but not triggering crashes, we introduce a new technique named __checking executions__. These checking executions are triggered periodically and check the coverage consistency w/ and w/o uncertain patchings. After each checking execution, the rewritten binary will get changed. `-x` option is for checking runnings.

Besides, we need to manually set the timeout for StochFuzz, which should be consistent with the one of AFL. `-t` option is for the timeout.

A good observation is that the edge coverage is at the block level, which means we do not need to trap all instructions but one instruction per block. This observation helps us avoid many rewriting errors.

## Case: Polyglot
