//
//  * certain_addresses: all the address which are *certainly* sure to be code
//                       bytes. The values of this dictionary have two types:
//                       the instruction size for each instruction boundary, and
//                       zero for the others.
//
//  * uncertain_patches: all the patches which are *uncertainly* sure. Most of
//                       them are patched based on the calculated probability.
//
//  *   certain_patches: all the patches which are *certainly* sure. The only
//                       patched value of this type is invalid inst. This kind
//                       of patches excludes the ones serve for bridge
//                       overlapping detection. It also exlucdes those code
//                       which was patched and has been revoked for delayed
//                       bridges.
//
//  *           bridges: all potential patch points which can help detect bridge
//                       overlapping.
//
//
// There are some relations between aforementioned fields.
//
//      keys(uncertain_patches).intersaction(keys(certain_addresses)) = EmptySet
